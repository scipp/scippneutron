    "# Coordinate Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "## About coordinate transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of essential coordinate transformations specific to neutron-scattering such as conversion from time-of-flight to $\\lambda$ (wavelength) or $Q$ (momentum transfer).\n",
    "Such coordinate transformations are also frequently referred to as \"unit conversion\", but here we avoid this terminology, to clearly distinguish from [conversion of array units using](https://scipp.github.io/generated/functions/scipp.to_unit.html#scipp.to_unit) `sc.to_unit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scipp provides [coordinate transformations using](https://scipp.github.io/user-guide/coordinate-transformations.html) `sc.transform_coords`.\n",
    "Scippneutron defines concrete transformations for time-of-flight neutron scattering, as well as building blocks for customizing transformations.\n",
    "Both are discussed in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Built-in transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of time-of-flight transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "For background, we refer to PaN-learning on [Introduction to neutron scattering](https://e-learning.pan-training.eu/wiki/index.php/Introduction_to_neutron_scattering) and [Basics of neutron scattering](https://e-learning.pan-training.eu/wiki/index.php/Basics_of_neutron_scattering).\n",
    "Below we also describe the more direct approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the beamline geometry as in this image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../_static/beamline/beamline_coordinates_light.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the source position defines the point where $t=0$ (or vice versa).\n",
    "And $2\\theta$ is the scattering angle, as defined in Bragg's law, not to be confused with $\\theta_{\\mathsf{spherical}}$ in sperical coordinates.\n",
    "In many instruments the beam is roughly aligned with the $z$-axis, so $2\\theta = \\theta_{\\mathsf{spherical}}$.\n",
    "The factor of $2$ is a recurrent source of bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $h$ is the Planck constant, $m_{\\mathsf{n}}$ is the neutron mass.\n",
    "- $d$ is the interplanar lattice spacing\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength\n",
    "- $\\vec{Q}$ (`Q_vec` in code) is the momentum transfer and $Q$ its norm\n",
    "- $E$ is the energy\n",
    "\n",
    "In the special case of inelastic neutron scattering we have additionally:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $E_i$ is the known incident energy. This case is called *direct inelastic scattering*.\n",
    "  We define $t_0 = \\sqrt{L_1^2 \\cdot m_{\\mathsf{n}} / (2 E_i)}$\n",
    "- $E_f$ is the known final energy. This case is called *indirect inelastic scattering*.\n",
    "  We define $t_0 = \\sqrt{L_2^2 \\cdot m_{\\mathsf{n}} / (2 E_f)}$\n",
    "  In this case $E_f$ is actually determined by analyzer crystals in the secondary flight path.\n",
    "  It is assumed that the detector positions are set to the effective (neutronic) rather than physical positions, since the computation of $L_2$ assumes a straight line connection between sample and detectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversions between these quantities are given by the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Input coord |Output coord |Equation used for coord transformation |\n",
    "|---|---|:---|\n",
    "|`tof`|`dspacing`|$d = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\sin(\\theta)} = \\frac{h \\cdot t}{L_{\\mathsf{total}} \\cdot m_{\\mathsf{n}} \\cdot 2 \\sin(\\theta)}$|\n",

    "\n",
    "The above table defines how an output coordinate such as `wavelength` is computed from inputs such as `Ltotal` and `tof`.\n",
    "In practice not all input data directly comes with all the required metadata.\n",
    "For example, instead of `Ltotal` the metadata may only contain `source_position`, `sample_position`, and `position`.\n",
    "These can then be used to compute derived metadata such as `Ltotal`.\n",
    "`transform_coords` can automatically do this by walking a transformation graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformations typically require two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A definition of the beamline geometry which defines, e.g., how scattering angles are to be computed from positions of beamline components such as sample and detector positions.\n",
    "2. A definition of the scattering kinematics and dynamics, e.g., how $\\lambda$ or $Q$ can be computed from time-of-flight for an elastic scattering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-defined standard components (transformation graphs and graph building blocks) are available in [scippneutron.conversion.graph](../generated/modules/scippneutron.conversion.graph.rst):"

    "   This could be used for imaging beamlines to ensure that all image sensor pixels have identical wavelength coordinates.\n",
    "1. [Diffraction calibration](#Diffraction-calibration) demonstrates a completely custom transformation without use of pre-defined graphs.\n",
    "   The example uses calibration results to compute the interplanar lattice spacing $d$, instead of computing $d$ using positions of beamline components.\n",
    "1. [2-D Rietveld](#2-D-Rietveld) demonstrates how a new node is added to an existing graph.\n",
    "   The example computes $d_{\\text{perp}}$ and $d$ as used in 2-D Rietveld.\n",
