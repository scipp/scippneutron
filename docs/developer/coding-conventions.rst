Coding conventions
==================

Formatting
----------

There are no explicit formatting conventions since we use ``yapf`` (Python).

Testing
-------

As a general rule all new functionality and bug fixes should be accompanied with sufficient unit tests to demonstrate that the feature or fix works as intended.
