    "In the figure above the index `i` labels source pulses.\n",
    "We define:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $T_0^i$ is the `event_time_zero` recorded in an `NXevent_data` group.\n",
    "  These times are indicated by the vertical dotted lines.\n",
    "- $T_0^{i+1} = T_0^i + L_0$ where the frame length $L_0$ is defined by $L_0 = 1/f_0$, given a source frequency $f_0$.\n",
    "- $\\Delta T_0$ is the offset from $T_0^i$ at which the neutrons are \"emitted\".\n",
    "  This may be zero (or half the pulse length) if the full pulse length is used, but choppers such as resolution choppers may extract a section of the pulse that is not aligned with the start of the full pulse.\n",
    "  This offset can also be used to take into account a potential difference between the timing system's definition of the pulse time and the actual beginning of the neutron pulse exiting, e.g., the moderator.\n",
    "- The black solid line within the first pulse (blue) indicates a neutron detected at $T_0^{i+1} + \\Delta t$.\n",
    "  $\\Delta t$ is the `event_time_offset` in an `NXevent_data` group.\n",
    "  This value is recorded for every neutron and gives the offset from the latest (previous) `event_time_zero` ($T_0^j$), i.e., the time difference to the previous vertical dotted line.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the time-of-flight for a neutron, we need to identify which source pulse it orginated from.\n",
    "Consider the shaded vertical band above, indicating the time during which arriving neutrons are associated with $T_0^{i+1}$.\n",
    "For, e.g., detector 1 when then observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First (small `event_time_offset` $\\Delta t$, to the left of the dashed black line) we see the slowest neutrons from N (in this case N=2) source pulses earlier.\n",
    "- Then (larger `event_time_offset` $\\Delta t$, to the right of the dashed black line) we see the slowest neutrons from N-1 (in this case N-1=1) source pulses earlier.\n",
    "- Typically there is is an intermediate region where no neutrons should be able to traverse the chopper cascade.\n",
    "  Neutrons detected in this time interval must thus be background from other sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the time-of-flight we add an integer multiple of the frame length to `event_time_offset`.\n",
    "Within a given frame (indicated above by a band between two dotted vertical lines, such as the grey shaded band) there is a *pivot time*:\n",
    "Neutrons with `event_time_offset` *before* the pivot time originated one source frame *before* neutrons *after* the pivot time.\n",
    "As illustrated in the figure, the pivot time $t_\\text{pivot}$ depends on the detector or rather the distance of the detector from the scattering position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pivot time can be computed, e.g., by defining the minimum wavelength $\\lambda_{\\text{min}}$ that can propagate through the chopper cascade to reach a detector.\n",
    "This is indicated above by the dashed black line.\n",
    "The computation of the time-of-flight can then proceed as follows (see also illustration below):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given $\\lambda_\\text{min}$, we can compute the the corresponding $t_{\\text{min}}$ (`tof_min`), i.e., the time the fastest neutrons take from the source to the detector.\n",
    "   `tof_min` is detector-dependent.\n",
    "2. The pivot time `time_offset_pivot` is computed as $t_\\text{pivot} = (\\Delta T_0 + t_{\\text{min}})\\mod L_0$.\n",
    "3. The time-of-flight $t_\\text{tof}$ is computed as\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   t_{\\text{tof}} =  t_{\\text{min}} - t_\\text{pivot} +\\Delta t + \n",
    "       \\begin{cases}\n",
    "       L_0, & \\text{for } \\Delta t \\lt t_\\text{pivot}\\\\\n",
    "       0, & \\text{for } \\Delta t \\ge t_\\text{pivot}\n",
    "       \\end{cases}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "Note that there are other valid definitions of $t_\\text{pivot}$, differing only in how neutrons in the intermediate \"background\" region (region between two pulses) are mapped to frames."
