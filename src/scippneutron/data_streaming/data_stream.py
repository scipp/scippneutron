    Additional info:
    - The `topics` argument is generally unused.
    - Instead, prefer the use of `run_info_topic` where it is possible to go
      and find the last run_start message and use that to get info on what
      topics to listen to.
    - Buffer sizes: it is currently not easy to resize scipp data structures,
      so we choose sensible default buffer sizes. This may need to be tweaked
      in the future.
    - `start_time`: it is possible to go back to the start of the run, even if
      `data_stream()` is started after or during the run. It simply finds the
      start time in the last run_start message. The data can persist on Kafka
      for a significant duration (hours? days?), making this lookup possible.
