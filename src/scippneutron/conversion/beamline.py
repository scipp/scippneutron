r"""Functions for computing coordinates related to beamline geometry.

Most functions in this module assume a straight beamline geometry.
That is, the beams are not curved by, e.g., a beam guide.
Specialized functions are provided for handling gravity.

ScippNeutron uses three positions to define a beamline:

- ``source_position`` defines the point where :math:`t=0` (or vice versa).
  In practice, this can be the actual neutron source, a moderator, or a chopper.
- ``sample_position`` is the position of the sample that scatters neutrons.
- ``position`` is the position of the detector (pixel / voxel) that detects a neutron
  at :math:`t=\mathsf{tof}`.

Based on these positions, we define:

- ``incident_beam`` is the vector of incoming neutrons on the sample.
  It points from the source to the sample.
  (:func:`straight_incident_beam`)
- ``L1`` (or :math:`L_1`) is the length of ``incident_beam``.
  (:func:`L1`)
- ``scattered_beam`` is the vector of neutrons that were scattered off the sample.
  It points from the sample to the detector pixels.
  (:func:`straight_scattered_beam`)
- ``L2`` (or :math:`L_2`) is the length of ``scattered_beam``.
  (:func:`L2`)
- ``Ltotal`` is the total beam length :math:`L_\mathsf{total} = L_1 + L_2`.
  (:func:`total_beam_length` and :func:`total_straight_beam_length_no_scatter`)

Coordinate system
-----------------

Note
----
  The coordinate system is not needed by most operations because beamline coordinates
  are usually relative to the positions.
  As long as ``position``, ``source_position``, and ``sample_position`` are defined
  consistently, ``incident_beam``, ``scattered_beam``, and ``two_theta`` can be
  computed without knowledge of the coordinate system.

  However, we need the actual coordinate system to compute ``phi``.

ScippNeutron uses a coordinate system aligned with
the incident beam and gravity.
ScippNeutron's coordinate system corresponds to that of
`NeXus <https://manual.nexusformat.org/design.html#the-nexus-coordinate-system>`_
when the incident beam is perpendicular to gravity.
The image below shows how coordinates are defined with respect to the
quantities defined above.
The plot on the right-hand side shows the view from the sample along the :math:`z`-axis,
that is, the :math:`z`-axis points towards the viewer.
(The sample is placed in the origin here; this is only done for illustration purposes
and not required.)

The axes are defined by these unit vectors:

.. math::

    \hat{e}_y &= -g / |g| \\
    z_{\text{proj}} &= b_1 - (b_1 \cdot \hat{e}_y) \hat{e}_y \\
    \hat{e}_z &= z_{\text{proj}} / |z_{\text{proj}}| \\
    \hat{e}_x &= \hat{e}_y \times \hat{e}_z

which span an orthogonal, right-handed coordinate system.
Here, :math:`b_1` is the ``incident_beam`` and :math:`g` is the gravity vector.
This means that the y-axis is antiparallel to gravity.
The z-axis is defined by projecting the incident beam onto a plane perpendicular
to gravity.
Basis vectors can be computed using :func:`beam_aligned_unit_vectors`.

:math:`p = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}` is the projection of the
scattered beam onto the :math:`x-y` plane.
It is included here because it is used by some coordinate transformations.

The scattering angles are defined similarly to spherical coordinates as:

.. math ::

    \mathsf{cos}(2\theta) &= \frac{b_1 \cdot b_2}{|b_1| |b_2|} \\
    \mathsf{tan}(\phi) &= \frac{b_2 \cdot \hat{e}_y}{b_2 \cdot \hat{e}_x}

where :math:`b_2` is the scattered beam.

- ``two_theta`` is the angle between the scattered beam and incident beam.
  Note the extra factor 2 compared to spherical coordinates;
  it ensures that the definition corresponds to Bragg's law.
- ``phi`` is the angle between the x-axis and the projection of the scattered beam
  onto the x-y-plane.

These definitions assume that gravity can be neglected.
See :func:`scattering_angles_with_gravity` for definitions that account for gravity.
And :func:`scattering_angle_in_yz_plane` for the definition used in reflectometry ---
which also includes gravity.

    With the definitions of the unit vectors in
    `Coordinate system <./scippneutron.conversion.beamline.rst#coordinate-system>`_,
    we have the components of the scattered beam :math:`b_2` in the beam-aligned
    coordinate system:

    .. math::

        x_d &= b_2 \cdot \hat{e}_x \\
        y_d &= b_2 \cdot \hat{e}_y \\

    :math:`b_2` points from the sample to the detector that detected the neutron.
    The neutron left the sample in the direction of a vector :math:`b'_2`.
    This vector defines the scattering angles :math:`2\theta` and :math:`\phi`.
    Taking gravity into account, we have :math:`b'_2 \neq b_2`.
    Solving the equations of motion gives the following for the
    components of :math:`b'_2`:

    .. math::

        x'_d &= x_d \\
        y'_d &= y_d + \delta_y \\
        z'_d &= z_d

    Where :math:`|g|` is the strength of gravity, :math:`m_n` is the neutron mass,
    :math:`h` is the Planck constant, :math:`\lambda` is the wavelength, and

    .. math::

        \delta_y = \frac{|g| m_n^2}{2 h^2} L_2^{\prime\, 2} \lambda^2

    This gives the gravity-corrected scattering angles:

    .. math::

        2\theta &= \sphericalangle(b_1, b_2 + \delta_y \hat{e}_y) \\
        \mathsf{tan}(\phi) &= \frac{y'_d}{x_d}

    where :math:`\sphericalangle` is the angle between two vectors as implemented by
    :func:`two_theta`.
    When :math:`b_1` is orthogonal to gravity, we can equivalently use

    .. math::

        \mathsf{tan}(2\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^{\prime\, 2}}}{z_d}

    This equation allowed for a more efficient implementation.

    Attention
    ---------
        The above equation for :math:`y'_d` contains :math:`L_2^{\prime\, 2} = |b'_2|`
        which in turn depends on :math:`y'_d`.
        Solving this equation for :math:`y'_d` is too difficult.
        Instead, we approximate :math:`L'_2 \approx L_2`.
        The impact of this approximation on :math:`2\theta` is of the order of
        :math:`10^{-6}` or less for beamlines at ESS.
        This is within the expected statistical uncertainties and can be ignored.
